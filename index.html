        <strong>Computers are a part of almost everything we do, from banking to streaming movies and videos to work (especially remote work). Given how important computers are to our lives, computer science is a field that's constantly growing and evolving. It's a field where your work can make a difference. Below, we'll take a closer look at computer science, careers in the field, and how to get started.</strong>

        <h1>Basics of computer science</h1>
        Computer science is the study of computers and how they work, including software, hardware, and algorithms. An algorithm is a list of instructions for completing a task. In computer science, an algorithm tells the computer what to do and how to do it.

        <p>Computer science is an umbrella term that covers everything from artificial intelligence and data science to robotics, game development, cybersecurity, and more. While you might think of computers like laptops or desktops, computer science involves everything to do with computing. That means everything from cell phones to ATMs to wearable technology like Fitbits.</p>
        <p>It's also a way of thinking. As Alex, one of our Curriculum Developers, explains:</p>
        <p class="comment"><em>"Computational thinking is about understanding how computers solve real-world problems. There are things we do every day that use computational thinking. If I'm meeting a friend at a restaurant, and I know where the restaurant is, I'll naturally find the shortest or most efficient path there. Being able to recognize how we think computationally and translating that to programming is a big part of gaining that foundational computer science knowledge."</em></p>

        <h1>A Multi-disciplinary science !</h1>
        As we advance into the 21st century, computer science is increasingly playing a central role in other disciplines, from science and engineering to humanities and arts.  Nearly all areas of academic and scholarly endeavor now rely on computer software for presenting and conducting academic research. Future generations of scientists, engineers, and artists will benefit from understanding and using principles of computer science and computational thinking.
        <p>Many of the most pressing problems of the day are best solved using interdisciplinary approaches. However, the standard paradigm in interdisciplinary work is that it requires participants to become fluent in all of the participating disciplines, sometimes sacrificing depth for the sake of breadth. A multidisciplinary approach modifies this scenario through the participation of specialists from different fields who have the necessary skills to communicate with each other and produce a collaborative solution through a common perspective.</p>
        <p>Regardless of their subject discipline, computer science majors should learn to communicate with specialists from other disciplines. Recently, a wide variety of interdisciplinary approaches to computer science education have been developed and described in the literature, ranging from entire programs to interdisciplinary courses that combine computer science with computer games, robotics, science, media, music, etc...</p>
